# üè° Project Description


This is a web application that manages the rental process for houses and apartments. It is structured to handle user interaction, property listings, and database management.

Technology Stack
Backend: PHP (used extensively, indicated by the high number of .php files and folder names like auth, app, and config).

Database: MySQL (implied by the inclusion of a database folder and the common PHP/MySQL stack).

Frontend: JavaScript, CSS (Styles and client-side interactions).

Core Features & Functionality
The application supports multiple user views and essential rental functionalities:

User Authentication: Includes dedicated pages for Registration and Login, ensuring secure access for different user types (implied: tenants and property owners/admins).

User Dashboard: A personalized area that users see after logging in. * Property Search: A dedicated search page that allows tenants to find properties, likely offering filtering options based on location, price, or type.

Database Management: The database folder suggests the project includes the necessary SQL files to set up the entire backend schema and store user and property data.

Modular Codebase: The folder structure (app, auth, config, include, mail) indicates a modular design approach, separating concerns such as application logic, authentication handling, configuration files, and email functionality.
